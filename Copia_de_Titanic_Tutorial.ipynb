Nevertheless, we really think all data scientists can rapidly learn from machine learning competitions and meaningfully contribute to our community. To give you a clear understanding of how our platform works and a mental model of the type of learning you could do on Kaggle, we've created a Getting Started tutorial for the Titanic competition. It walks you through the initial steps required to get your first decent submission on the leaderboard. By the end of the tutorial, you'll also have a solid understanding of how to use Kaggle's online coding environment, where you'll have trained your own machine learning model.\n",
